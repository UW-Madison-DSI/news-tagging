    "summary": "In this summer's blockbuster movie of the same name, Barbie stares down an existential crisis. For humans in the real world, UW's Center for Healthy Minds has some well-tested guidance, along with a free app, for navigating life's challenges and cultivating well-being.",
    "content": "Confronted with an existential crisis of identity, Barbie sets off on a journey in search of answers. Warner Bros.\nThanks to Barbie, the new live-action film that’s setting box-office records globally, Barbie is not only making us think pink — she’s really making us think.\nWithout giving away spoilers, the film tells the story of the beloved — and, at times, controversial — children’s doll, who wakes one morning in Barbie World with a sudden-onset existential crisis. A day of spoiled milk, flat feet and more set Barbie on an epic journey from Barbie World to the real world in search of answers. Her journey may be resonating so deeply with movie audiences because, like many of us in the real world, Barbie can&#8217;t rest until she uncovers her purpose. But she’s at a loss for where to begin.\nSound familiar?\nVeiled in light-heartedness and bubble-gum pink visuals, Barbie’s journey takes on serious questions of purpose, meaning and connection. These are also questions faculty and scientists take on in their research at the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\nIf only Barbie could learn about the Healthy Minds Framework for Well-being.\nWhat is the Healthy Minds Framework?\nCreated from research at the center and built on decades of research, the Healthy Minds Framework helps those of us in the real world understand how to flourish as humans.\nTo live a healthy life, science points to nurturing four major pillars of well-being:\n\nAwareness\nConnection\nInsight\nPurpose\n\nResearch has shown that specific networks in our brains can work to strengthen our awareness, connection, insight and purpose. One way to build that strength is through meditation and other forms of mental training.\nWhy is purpose important to well-being?\nGoing back to Barbie’s journey, why is it important for all the Barbies, Kens and everyone in between, to have a sense of purpose? Understanding how the research defines purpose is a starting point.\nThe center’s research defines purpose as “being clear about your core values and deeper motivation and being able to apply them in your daily life.”\nNeuroscientist and Center Director/Founder Richard J. Davidson recently explained that purpose is about finding your “true north” in life.\n“It’s not so much about finding something more purposeful to do, so to speak, but how can we derive meaning and purpose from that which we are already doing,” Davidson said in a 2023 episode of Wisconsin Public Radio’s University of the Air podcast.\nA strong sense of purpose is associated with real-life improvements to well-being and health. The research, including a 2020 published paper, points to:\n\nIncreased physical activity\nDecreased incidence of stroke\nFewer cardiovascular events\nReduced risk of death\nLower health care utilization\nBetter financial health\n\nFor those of us without a set storyline like Barbie, understanding how to start building purpose can prove perplexing.\nOne way to start building a sense of purpose through the Healthy Minds Framework is to use the free mindfulness app called Healthy Minds Program. The app leads you through a guided path with practices rooted in the pillars of awareness, connection, insight and, of course, purpose.\nUsing neuroscience, contemplative traditions and skill-based learning methods, the app helps you develop the skills for a healthy mind.\nSo, no matter if you feel like Barbie, Ken or just a human being, one thing’s for sure: Out here in the real world, understanding your purpose is more than a far-off concept. It’s vital to your well-being. Hey, Barbie! What are you waiting for?\n\nFor more updates on well-being, research and neuroscience, sign up for the Center for Healthy Minds newsletter.",
