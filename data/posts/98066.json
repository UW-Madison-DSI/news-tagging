    "content": "Summer in Madison is a lot of things, but it&#8217;s definitely not boring. As August winds down, students, faculty and staff are gearing up for another academic year. In case you missed it, here&#8217;s a look back at some highlights from summer 2023.\nA new generation of Badgers\nCampus and Visitor Relations tour guide, Olivia, leads a group of students on a tour across campus.

The iconic space is one of many designated “no mow” areas on campus. “We’ve been trained to be as sustainable as possible,&#8221; says Building &amp; Grounds Supervisor Robert Scott.\n\n\nSpring seeds for the summer glowup, #FutureBadger. ⁠⁠ @UWMadison pic.twitter.com/Q9k19yIZFY\n&mdash; UW–Madison Admissions (@UWAdmissions) May 30, 2023\n\n\nScience marches on\nNacho Vivas, lab manager at the Rey Lab in the Bacteriology Department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, checks on a group of germ-free mice inside a sterile lab environment.

UW researchers announced learnings that shape what we know about our early human ancestors, heart disease, gene editing therapy to treat blindness and the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nLearning on their own (Summer) Term\nMike Heim, a science faculty member at Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe University who specializes in horticulture, demonstrates the translucent qualities of aquatic vegetation during a visit to the Lac Courte Oreilles manoomin (wild rice) restoration research ponds. Maria Moreno\nStudents navigated the waters of the Chippewa Flowage during a weeklong summer field course that interweaves Native history and culture with science education. Each summer, hundreds of Badgers take advantage of Summer Term to lighten their course load during the fall and spring semesters, get hands-on career experience and even graduate early. Fun fact: The average undergrad at UW–Madison earns their degree in less than four years — 3.85 to be exact.\n\nRelated: UW students get taste of real-world learning\n\nThe early bird gets the tickets&#8230; maybe.\nStudent fans cheer and make an &#8220;O&#8221; with their arms, to signify pride in their section.

This year&#8217;s sale was only boosted by the excitement surrounding Luke Fickell&#8217;s first season as head football coach. &#8220;I ended up waking up at around 4:55 a.m. just to set up all my devices to be ready to join the queue,&#8221; says Jacqueline Renaud, an incoming junior from southern California.\n\n\n𝗧𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗞 𝗬𝗢𝗨 𝗦𝗧𝗨𝗗𝗘𝗡𝗧𝗦 @CoachFick and the rest of the team can’t wait to see you at Camp Randall this fall  pic.twitter.com/zyxaKyZyVY\n&mdash; Wisconsin Football (@BadgerFootball) June 15, 2023\n\n\nUW turns 175\nA fireworks show takes place on Lake Mendota during the 175th Anniversary Launch Day Celebration at the Memorial Union Terrace on July 26, 2023. Photo: Bryce Richter\nOn July 26, UW–Madison celebrated a milestone 175 years in the making. In true Wisconsin fashion, the kick-off event (hosted 175 years to the day since the University of Wisconsin was founded) included music, cheese and of course, Bucky Badger. And an anniversary this big needs a pretty big party—festivities will continue through the 2023-24 academic year.\n\nRelated: New Bucky on Parade celebrates 175 years, honors UW–Madison’s past, present and future\n\nSOARing to new heights\nAt center, new student leader and second-year transfer student Diego Martinez leads a group of incoming first-year students in conversations and ice breakers.

She joined her son, an incoming freshman, during the summer session where she navigated her &#8220;fresh parent feelings&#8221; while also highlighting the people who make the annual tradition possible.\n\nTerrace Time\nNeed we say more?\nAs the temperatures warm, students flock to Goodspeed Family Pier to watch the sun set over Lake Mendota.
